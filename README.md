Design Brief
WakeCup is a boutique coffee company based in Seattle and specializes in unique coffee blends from hand-picked coffee plantations from around the world. WakeCup offers a range of coffee powders, brewing equipment and has a handful of cafeterias where one can enjoy coffee over great conversation and ambience. The company, which started in 2006 has had a terrible website and wants to start afresh to gain traction in the venture capital market as they’re keen on expanding their presence and crossing borders to other countries in Americas and Europe and perhaps later, the world.
